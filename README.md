# studyflow

Productivity tool that helps students transitioning to university with managing their tasks. Designed to help university students, but can be used by anyone to manage their classwork and time. We plan to include features such as a to-do list, a built-in study timer, an assignments list sorted by priority, dark mode, trend charts to track your progress, and a calendar view for all tasks. It is a bundle of tools all in one.
